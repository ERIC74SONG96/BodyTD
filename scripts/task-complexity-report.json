      "taskTitle": "Refactor GameManager to Expose State via StateFlow",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of refactoring GameManager to use StateFlow for each core state element, including initializing MutableStateFlows, exposing immutable versions, updating all state-modifying methods, ensuring atomic updates, and verifying correct propagation of state changes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant architectural changes to core game logic, introducing reactive state management with StateFlow. It requires careful handling of concurrency, atomicity, and ensuring all state changes are properly emitted and observed. The risk of introducing subtle bugs is high, and thorough testing is needed to ensure correctness and maintainability.[6][9]"

      "taskTitle": "Refactor GameViewModel to Observe GameManager StateFlows",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to replace manual polling in GameViewModel with StateFlow collectors, including removing the polling loop, setting up collectors for each state, updating ViewModel state, handling exceptions, and verifying UI propagation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires replacing imperative polling with reactive collectors, which impacts how the ViewModel interacts with the game state. It introduces coroutine-based state observation, exception handling, and synchronization with the UI, demanding careful coordination and testing.[6][9]"

      "taskTitle": "Update GameScreen to Use Live ViewModel State",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to migrate GameScreen from local remembered states to directly observing ViewModel state, including identifying usages, replacing with ViewModel references, updating child composables, and verifying UI correctness.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves updating UI code to use reactive state from the ViewModel, which is a common but non-trivial refactor. It requires careful identification of all state usages, updating data flows, and ensuring UI consistency and correctness.[6][9]"

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of win/loss logic, including adding checks for lives and wave completion, triggering state transitions, implementing end state classes, and verifying all scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, involving the addition of clear game-ending conditions and state transitions. While conceptually straightforward, it requires careful integration and testing to ensure all edge cases are handled.[3][8]"

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps to move tower cost data from the ViewModel to the game logic layer, including removing old definitions, adding properties to classes, updating usages, and verifying consistency.",
      "reasoning": "Centralizing data definitions improves maintainability but requires updating multiple classes and usages throughout the codebase. Ensuring all references are updated and consistent adds to the complexity.[3][4]"

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of identifying, verifying, and safely removing unused UI files, including checking for references and testing after deletion.",
      "reasoning": "This is a low-complexity cleanup task, involving file identification and safe removal. The main risk is accidental deletion of needed files, mitigated by thorough checks and testing.[3][7]"
